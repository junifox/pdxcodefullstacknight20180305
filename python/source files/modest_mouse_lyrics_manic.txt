This plane is definitely crashing
This boat is obviously sinking
This building's totally burning down
And my, and my (a whole bunch)
And my heart has slowly dried up
I guess I am a scout
So I should find a way out
So everyone can find a way out
They keep us in
To pull us out
I'm rising up
Wish I was sinking down
And it's not like
There was warning
We were happy
And it's not like
There was mourning
In the warning
I know I am a scout
I should've found a way out
So everyone can find a way out
I know I am a scout
I should've found a way out
So everyone can find a way out
Instead of seeing a neighbor out
God, I wish I would've found a way out
It's the last time
We were happy
Ever happy
I know I was a scout
I should've found a way out
So everyone could find a way out
Well I know I was a scout
I should've found a way out
So everyone could find a way out
Well I know I was a scout
I should've found a way out
So everyone could find a way out
All those people that you know.
All those people that you know.
All those people that you know,
floatin' in the river are logs.
I could buy myself a reason.
I could sell myself a job.
I could hang myself on treason.
All the folks I know are gone.
All the people that you know.
All the people that you know.
All the people that you know
floatin' in the river are logs.
So I ate the wedding cake
'til the whole damn thing was gone.
And I'm gonna drown the ocean.
Now ain't none o' that so wrong?
All the people that you know.
All those people that you know.
All those people that you know
floatin' in the river are gone.
Gonna take this sack of puppies.
Gonna set it out to freeze.
Gonna climb around on all fours
'til all the blood falls out my knees.
All the people that you know.
All the people that you know.
All those people that you know
floatin' in the river are logs.
Well let's take this potted plant
to the woods and set it free.
I'm gonna tell the owners
just how nice that was of me.
I could buy myself a reason.
I could sell myself a job.
I could hang myself on treason.
Oh I am my own damn god.
HA, HA, HA, HA, HA, HA, HA
