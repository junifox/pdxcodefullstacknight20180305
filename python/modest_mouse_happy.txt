Well, it would've been, could've been worse than you would ever know.
Oh, the dashboard melted, but we still have the radio.
Oh, it should've been, could've been worse than you would ever know.
Well, you told me about nowhere well it sounds like someplace I'd like to go.
Oh, it could've been, should've been worse than you would ever know.
Well, the windshield was broken but I love the fresh air you know.
(The dashboard melted but we still have the radio)
Oh, it would've been, could've been worse than you would ever know, oh!
(The dashboard melted but we still have the radio)
Oh, we talked about nothing which was more than I wanted you to know-oh-oh-oh-oh.
Now here we go!
Oh! It would've been, could've been worse than it had even gone
Well, the car was on blocks, but I was already where I want.
(It was impossible, we ran it good, we ran it good)
Why should we ever even ever really even get to know?
(It was impossible, we ran it good, we ran it good)
Oh if the world don't like us it'll shake us just like we were a co-oh-oh-oh-old.
Now here we go!
Well we scheme and we scheme but we always blow it
We've yet to crash, but we still might as well tow it
Standing at a light switch to each east and west horizon,
Every dawn you're surprising,
and in the evening one's consoling
Saying "See it wasn't quite as bad as"
Well, it would've been, could've been worse than you would ever know.
I was patiently erasing and recording the wrong episodes
After you had proved my point wrong,
It wasn't like I'd let it go, oh-oh-oh. Oh-oh-oh.
I just wanted to catch the last laugh of this show.
Yeah, it would've been, could've been worse than you would ever know.
Oh, the dashboard melted, but we still have the radio.
(The dashboard melted, but we ran it good, we ran it good)
Hard-wired to conceive, so much we'd have to stow it
Even needs have needs, tiny giants made of tinier giants.
Don't wear eyelids so I don't miss the last laugh of this show.
(The dashboard melted but we still have the radio)
Oh, we could've been, should've been worse than you would ever know.
(The dashboard melted but we still have the radio)
Well, you told me about nowhere well it sounds like someplace I'd like to go-oh-oh-oh-oh.
Now here we go!
Well we scheme and we scheme but we always blow it
We've yet to crash, but we still might as well tow it
Standing at a light switch to each east and west horizon,
Every dawn you're surprising,
and in the evening one's consoling
Saying "See it wasn't quite as bad as"
Oh it would've been, could've been worse than you would ever know.
I backed my car into a cop car the other day
Well he just drove off sometimes life's OK
I ran my mouth off a bit too much oh what did I say
Well you just laughed it off it was all OK
And we'll all float on OK
And we'll all float on OK
And we'll all float on OK
And we'll all float on any way
Well, a fake Jamaican took every last dime with that scam
It was worth it just to learn from sleight of hand
Bad news comes don't you worry even when it lands
Good news will work its way to all them plans
We both got fired on exactly the same day
Well we'll float on good news is on the way
And we'll all float on OK
And we'll all float on OK
And we'll all float on OK
And we'll all float on alright
Already we'll all float on
Now don't you worry we'll all float on alright
Already we'll all float on alright
Don't worry we'll all float on
(Alright already)
And we'll all float on alright
Already we'll all float on alright
Don't worry even if things end up a bit too heavy
We'll all float on alright
Already we'll all float on alright
Already we'll all float on OK
Don't worry we'll all float on
Even if things get heavy we'll all float on alright
Already we'll all float on alright
Don't you worry we'll all float on alright
We'll all float on
Soon the chain reaction started in the parking lot
Waiting to bleed on the big streets
That bleed out on the highways and
Off to others cities built to store and
sell these (plastic) rocks
Well aren't you feeling real dirty
Sitting in the parking lot
Soon the chain reaction started in the parking lot
Waiting to bleed on the big streets
That bleed out on the highways and
Off to others cities built to store and
sell these (plastic) rocks
Well aren't you feeling real dirty
And I said you shouldn't make facts out of opinions
He said that I was right
You're right I knew that I was
And I'd hate to see anybody thank you
But I'd like to see you fail saying thank you though
I'm not sure who I am
I'm not sure who I am but I know who I've been
And I said you can't make everybody happy
He said you'd like to at least make yourself happy though
I'm not sure who I am
I'm not sure who I am but I know who I've been
Won herself a pass to some far off moon
It was second class but what's to lose
And looking out her window she could more than assume
That you can't see air or time
She's the only rocketeer in the whole damn place
They gave her a mirror so she could talk to a face
She still got plenty lonely but that's just the case
With time, time, time
Started hearing voices sometime in June
She knew she could go crazy but didn't think that soon
Now she doesn't feel lonely but she'd just as soon
Try, try, try try
Man shot to the moon
I read a paperback and want to come home soon
I'm shot to the moon
Been there a half an hour, I want to come home soon
From the top of the ocean - Yeah
From the bottom of the sky -Goddamn
Well I get claustrophobic
I can you know that I can
And he said:
"I am not allowed much danger
keep in line you're an old friend stranger.
you'll burn me if effigy and I'll burn you in effigy."
A rattle snake up in buffalo Montana
he bit the leg of the old sheriff
Ha! That boy fell down on his harelip -Ow! Ow!
Well I might be wrong
but you you tag along
and we we all been wronged
and I get dizzier by the mile
Said hell! The money's spent
went to the county line
and paid the rent said "Uh-oh."
Oh! If you could compact your conscience
Oh! And you might.
Oh! If you could bottle and sell it you might have done
Oh! And you might
Oh! If you could compact your conscience
and sell it save it for another time
you might have to use it.
And the televisions gone
Go to the grocery store, buy some new friends
and find out the beginning, the end, and the best of it
Well, do you need a lot of what you've got to survive?
Here's the man with teeth like God's shoeshine
He sparkles shimmers shines
let's all have another Orange Julius
This syrup standing in lines
The malls are the soon to be ghost towns
so long, farewell, good-bye
Take 'em all for the long ride
and you'll go around town
no one wants to be uptight anymore
You can be ashamed
or be so proud of what you've done
but not no one, not now, not ever or anyone
take 'em all for the sense of happiness
that comes from hurting deep down inside
Or you can walk th line and give a shit
I'm on the corner of this and this and this and this
and its all all wrong, and its all all gone
Well, you can add it up and give a shit
go to the family doctor
Its all worth it
and its all all gone, and its all all wrong
Here's the man with teeth like God's shoeshine
He sparkles shimmers shines
let's all have another Orange Julius
Thick syrup standing in lines
The malls are the soon to be ghost towns
so long, farewell, good-bye
And the telephone goes off
pick to receiver up, try to meet ends
and find out the beginning, the end and the best of it
